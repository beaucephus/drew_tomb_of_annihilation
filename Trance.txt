====== Trance ======
Created Tuesday 05 November 2019

Elvesdon’tneedtosleep.Instead,they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4
hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation
is “trance.”) W hile meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

====== Kurai's Background ======
Created Thursday 07 November 2019

Kurai Takeru is a high-elven rogue(2)/fighter(5) in his 99th year. He is a lightly-armored, dextrous front-line skirmisher who dual-wields short swords with critical accuracy.
He is honor-bound by Fisha clan custom to venture out and accomplish great achievements in the world before his 100th birthday when he can return home to accept his station and wife in the clan.
Kurai is especially drawn to Chult because he has heard that many exotic animals live on the island. He plans to capture such an animal and train it to be used as a mount. "That will ensure I received a station of high standing in the Fisha."

Kurai Takeru, experienced adventurer that he is, is no stranger to picking out new leads from tavern gossip. Recently the latest babble to keep the local rabble of Baldur's Gate entertained has all been about Chult. Upon hearing some of these rumors, he is immediately smitten with the idea of traveling to the island to conquer and tame an exotic beast. In the course of his preparations, he continues to pickup more tidbits of information.
Among the often contradictory rumors circulating through the populace, one such tidbit he makes note of is that if he wants to have any chance of actually taking any tamed creature home with him, he should seek out the [[Ytepka Society]] - a rather mysterious group dedicated to preserving the cultural heritage of Chult. Or so he hears at least.
Armed with this knowledge, Kurai only seeks a means to actually reach the island, as he has found himself rather financially unstable after recent purchases. It is then that a notice is posted seeking a number of adventurers to embark on a potentially dangerous and very profitable expedition to Chult...

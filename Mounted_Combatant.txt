====== Mounted Combatant ======
Created Thursday 23 April 2020

You are a dangerous foe to face while mounted. While you are mounted and aren't incapacitated, you gain the following benefits:
* You have advantage on melee attack rolls against unmounted creatures that are smaller than your mount.
* You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.
* If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity save to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds and half damage if it fails.

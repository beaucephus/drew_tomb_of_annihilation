====== Inured to Undeath ======
Created Thursday 01 October 2020

Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced.

You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.

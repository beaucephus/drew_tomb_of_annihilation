====== Fey Step ======
Created Thursday 24 September 2020

As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach 3rd level, your Fey Step gains an additional effect based on your season; if the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier:

Winter. When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn

====== Action Surge ======
Created Tuesday 05 November 2019

Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. 
On Your Turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible Bonus Action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or Long Rest before you can use it again. 
Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

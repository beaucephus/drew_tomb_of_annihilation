====== Arcane Recovery ======
Created Thursday 01 October 2020

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your Spellbook.
Once per day when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended Spell Slots to recover.
The Spell Slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Wizard level (rounded up),
and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

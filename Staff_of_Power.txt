 Staff of Power

Requires Attunement by a Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard

This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with it.
While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, Saving Throws, and spell Attack rolls.

The staff has 20 Charges for the following properties. 
The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended Charges daily at dawn.
If you expend the last charge, roll a d20.
On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to Attack and damage roll but loses all other properties.
On a 20, the staff regain 1d8 + 2 Charges.

Power Strike: When you hit with a melee Attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.

Spells: While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its Charges to cast one of the following Spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell Attack bonus: 
Cone of Cold (5 charges), 
Fireball (5th-level version, 5 charges), 
Globe of Invulnerability (6 charges), 
Hold Monster (5 charges), 
Levitate (2 charges). 
Lightning Bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), 
Magic Missile (1 charge), 
Ray of Enfeeblement (1 charge), or 
Wall of Force (5 charges).

Retributive Strike: You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. 
The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on it.
You have a 50 percent chance to instantly Travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion.
If you fail to avoid the Effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of Charges in the staff.
Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of Origin, as shown in the following table.
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

Distance from Origin — Damage:
10 ft. away or closer — 8 x the number of Charges in the staff
11 to 20 ft. away — 6 x the number of Charges in the staff
21 to 30 ft. away — 4 x the number of Charges in the staff

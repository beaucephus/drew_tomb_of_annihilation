====== Skull Amulet ======
Created Friday 24 July 2020

This amulet is carved from obsidian and shaped like a screaming humanoid skull, with ruby eyes and emeralds for teeth. It hangs from an iron chain necklace.

The amulet has 6 charges and regains 1d6 charges daily at dawn. While wearing the amulet, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to transport yourself and anything you are wearing or carrying to a location within 100 feet of you. The destination you choose doesn’t need to be in your line of sight, but it must be familiar to you (in other words, a place you have seen or visited), and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. This effect isn’t subject to the magic restrictions placed on the Tomb of the Nine Gods
You are also aware the amulet is cursed, though the nature of the curse eludes you, you determine it may occasionally have detrimental effects on the living.

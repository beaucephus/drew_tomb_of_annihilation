====== Necklace of Fireballs ======
Created Friday 21 August 2020

8 charges

This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. 
You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. 
When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level Fireball spell (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. 
When you do so, increase the level of the Fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.
